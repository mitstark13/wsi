# WSI - Markup - Challenge

Assuptions:

	- As no design was given, I was assuming that no responsive/mobile view was needed for this challenge. I probably would have added the first large image to the product description side and made that full width.
	- All product info, images, and content was hard coded. I debated putting the information and images in a json file and pulling that in with a loadProduct type function, but that seemed a little over the top for this.
	- I chose not to use any outside libraries/frameworks like bootstrap or React since none were mentioned in the email or readme.rtf.

Apps used:

	- Koala for compiling scss files into css. (Kept "show line-comments" on)
	- Colorzilla chrome extention to get some of the colors from the image
